          R is a programming language and software environment for statistical
          analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R was created by Ross
          Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand,
          and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows
          branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
          R allows integration with the procedures written in the C, C++, .Net,
          Python or FORTRAN languages for efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and
          pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating
          systems like Linux, Windows and Mac.

          As stated earlier, R is a programming language and software
          environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and
          reporting. The following are the important features of R −
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language
            which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions
            and input and output facilities.
          </li>
          <li>R has an effective data handling and storage facility,</li>
          <li>
            R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists,
            vectors and matrices.
          </li>
          <li>
            R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for
            data analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either
            directly at the computer or printing at the papers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a conclusion, R is world’s most widely used statistics programming
          language. It's the # 1 choice of data scientists and supported by a
          vibrant and talented community of contributors. R is taught in
          universities and deployed in mission critical business applications.

          As a convention, we will start learning R programming by writing a
          "Hello, World!" program. Depending on the needs, you can program
          either at R command prompt or you can use an R script file to write
          your program. Let's check both one by one.
        </p>
        <h3>R Command Prompt</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have R environment setup, then it’s easy to start your R
          command prompt by just typing the following command at your command
          prompt −
        </p>
        <code> $ R </code>
        <p>
          This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt > where you
          can start typing your program as follows −
        </p>
        <code>
          <span>>myString <- "Hello, World!"</span>
          <span>>print ( myString)</span>
          <span>[1] "Hello, World!" </span>
        </code>
        <p>
          Here first statement defines a string variable myString, where we
          assign a string "Hello, World!" and then next statement print() is
          being used to print the value stored in variable myString.
        </p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>
          Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored
          by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment
          is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows −
        </p>
        <code class="comments"># My first program in R Programming</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          Generally, while doing programming in any programming language, you
          need to use various variables to store various information. Variables
          are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means
          that, when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may like to store information of various data types like
          character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating
          point, Boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the
          operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in
          the reserved memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to other programming languages like C and java in R, the
          variables are not declared as some data type. The variables are
          assigned with R-Objects and the data type of the R-object becomes the
          data type of the variable. There are many types of R-objects. The
          frequently used ones are −
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vectors</li>
          <!-- For the upcoming sections about them, write from data types's section-->
          <li>Lists</li>
          <li>Matrices</li>
          <li>Arrays</li>
          <li>Factors</li>
          <li>Data Frames</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can
          manipulate. A variable in R can store an atomic vector, group of
          atomic vectors or a combination of many R objects. A valid variable
          name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters.
          The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a
          number.
        </p>
        <h3>Variable Assignment</h3>
        <p>
          The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and
          equal to operator. The values of the variables can be printed using
          <b>print()</b> or <b>cat()</b> function. The <b>cat()</b> function
          combines multiple items into a continuous print output.
        </p>
        <code>
          <span class="comments"># Assignment using equal operator.</span>
          var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)
          <span class="comments"> # Assignment using leftward operator.</span>
          var.2 <- c("learn","R")
          <span class="comments"># Assignment using rightward operator.</span>
          c(TRUE,1) -> var.3
          <!--input-->
          <span>print(var.1)</span>
          <span>cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")</span>
          <span>cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")</span>
          <span>cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")</span>
        </code>
        <p>
          When we execute the above code, it produces the following result −
        </p>
        <code>
          <span>[1] 0 1 2 3</span>
          <span>var.1 is 0 1 2 3</span>
          <span>>var.2 is learn R</span>
          <span>var.3 is 1 1</span>
        </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="operators">
        <header>Operators</header>
        <p>
          An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific
          mathematical or logical manipulations. R language is rich in built-in
          operators and provides following types of operators.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Operators</h3>
        <p>We have the following types of operators in R programming −</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
          <li>Relational Operators</li>
          <li>Logical Operators</li>
          <li>Assignment Operators</li>
          <li>Miscellaneous Operators</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="decision_making">
        <header>Decision Making</header>
        <p>
          Decision making structures require the programmer to specify one or
          more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a
          statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined
          to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if
          the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure
          found in most of the programming languages −
        </p>
        <img  class="res-img" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/images/r_decision_making.png" alt="if-else statement" />
        <p>R provides the following types of decision making statements:</p>
        <table >
          <tr >
            <th>Sr.No.</th>
            <th>Statement & Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>
              if statement
              <p>
                An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed
                by one or more statements.
              </p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>
              if...else statement
              <p>
                An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional
                <b>else</b> statement, which executes when the Boolean
                expression is false.
              </p>
            </td>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>switch statement
              <p>A <b>switch</b> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements
          are
          executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
        <p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
        <p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the
          general
          form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages −
        </p>
        <img  class="res-img" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/images/loop_architecture.jpg" alt="loop-explained">
        <p>R programming language provides the following kinds of loop to handle looping requirements:</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>
              Sr.No.
            </th>
            <th>Loop Type & Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>repeat loop
              <p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>while loop
              <p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before
                executing the
                loop body.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>for loop
              <p>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built
          functions and the user can create their own functions.</p>
        <p>In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments
          that
          may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions.</p>
        <p>The function in turn performs its task and returns control to the interpreter as well as any result which may be
          stored
          in other objects.</p>
        <h3>Function Definition</h3>
        <p>An R function is created by using the keyword <b>function</b>. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as
          follows −</p>
        <code>
                
                <span> function_name <- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) </span>
                <span>{</span>
                 <span>  Function body </span>
              <span>  } </span>
                
              </code>
        <h3>Function Components</h3>
        <p>The different parts of a function are −</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Function Name</b> − This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with
            this name.</li>
          <li><b>Arguments</b> − An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument.
            Arguments are
            optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.</li>
          <li><b>Function Body</b> − The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function
            does.</li>
          <li><b>Return Value</b> − The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be
            evaluated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          R has many <b>in-built functions</b> which can be directly called in the program without defining them first. We can
          also
          create and use our own functions referred as <b>user defined functions</b>.
