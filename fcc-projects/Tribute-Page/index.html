                FC Barcelona, in full Fútbol Club Barcelona,
                is a Spanish professional football (soccer) club located in Barcelona. FC
                Barcelona is renowned for its historically skillful and attractive
                brand of attacking football that places an emphasis on flowing, open
                play. The team is part of a wider sports and social club with
                thousands of members.

                FC Barcelona was formed in 1899 by businessman Joan Gamper, who
                advertised for players in a local Barcelona sports magazine. The
                club’s first trophy was the Copa Macaya (Catalan championship) in
                1902, and in 1910 “Barça” won the Copa del Rey (“King’s Cup”)—Spain’s
                leading national football cup competition—for the first time. In
                total, Barcelona has won 30 Copas del Rey, more than any other team.

                La Liga, the top Spanish football league, was formed in 1929, and
                Barcelona captured the title in the league’s inaugural season. The
                club has won La Liga 26 times and has never been relegated to a lower
                division.
